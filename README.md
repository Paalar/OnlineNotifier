# OnlineNotifier
In progress. An App that gives you information about the status of the office for the student organization Online like if it is occupied for a meeting or when the coffee was most recently made. Using a public API so it can stop working at any time.

The app is seperated into 3 different parts. The office, the cantinas, and meetings at the office. 

The office part shows information about how many pots of coffee has been made and when it was most recently made (to see if its fresh).
During normal weekdays of the semester there will also be people that will be responsible for the office from 10-16 and will show up as list elements with their names and when they start.

The meetings can be scheduled (not from the app) and when confirmed will pop up under the application and from start time to ending time.

The cantina part is a list of all the available cantinas around in Trondheim and the time of when it will open/close. 
Later functionality will add possibility for tapping the list element and see what kind of meals they are offering.
